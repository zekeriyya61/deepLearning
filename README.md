# Deep Learning
There are many project about Deep Learning with using different algorithms and models.
1. faster_rcnn-object_detection
   - There are many step to create own train dataset to object detection. 
     - Collect at least 500 images that contain your object - The bare minimum would be about 100, ideally more like 1000 or more, but, the more images you have, the more tedious step 2 will be.
     - Split this data into train/test samples. Training data should be around 80% and testing around 20%.
     - Generate TF Records from these splits.
     - Setup a .config file for the model of choice (you could train your own from scratch, but we'll be using transfer learning).
     - Train our model.
     - Export inference graph from new trained model.
     - Detect custom objects in real time.
